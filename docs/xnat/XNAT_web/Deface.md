## Defacing Brain Scans.
Since, 2D MR scans can be reconstructed in 3D space. They are a threat to individual patient privacy as, the 3D reconstruction can be used for patient identification.

Therefore, we use algorithms, to deface the scans like ``pydeface``. 
- Enable ``pydeface`` in the _Project Settings_.
- Then go to the ``Processing Dashboard`` in the ``Actions`` Menu.
- Click on ``MR Sessions``.
- Select the subjects on which you want to run this process. Choose pydeface and launch the process.

- Wait for the process to be completed.

Now, If we look at 3D reconstruction of say T2 weighted scan, it gets defaced like this:
